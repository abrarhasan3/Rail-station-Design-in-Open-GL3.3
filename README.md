## Features

- **Modern OpenGL (3.3):** Utilizes the modern OpenGL framework for efficient rendering.
- **Direct Implimantation:** Directly takes points from an image and draw it. Simple implimentation. 
- **Cross-Platform:** Designed to work seamlessly across different platforms.

## Requirements

**This requiements are only required if you want to start from scratch. If you dont want to do all these stuff, there is a folder in the repository named OpenGL. Inside there, there is two more folder, lib and include. You just have to include these folder paths in your project. For better understanding see the video.**
