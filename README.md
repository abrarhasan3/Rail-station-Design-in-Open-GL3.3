# Rail-station-Design-in-Open-GL3.3

This project showcases a visually engaging scene of a railway station created using Modern OpenGL (3.3). Leveraging the power of shaders, vertex buffers, and textures, the implementation brings to life a dynamic and immersive representation of a bustling railway environment.

This project includes implimentation on:
- Vertex Shader and Fragment Shader
- Lighting (Point Light, Directional Light, Spot Light)
- Texture
- Bézier curve

## Features

- **Modern OpenGL (3.3):** Utilizes the latest OpenGL features for efficient rendering and realistic graphics.
- **Shader Programs:** Implements vertex and fragment shaders to achieve lifelike lighting and shading effects.
- **Texture Mapping:** Applies textures to various elements within the scene for enhanced visual realism.
- **Bézier curve:** Impliments Bézier curve to create realistic curvy objects like pillers, wheel, face of train. 
- **Dynamic Elements:** Introduces dynamic elements such as moving trains, rotating fan and changing lighting conditions.
- **User Interaction:** Allows users to navigate and explore the railway station scene interactively.
- **Cross-Platform:** Designed to work seamlessly across different platforms.
